# MIPS
Simple MIPS Simulator


Under the MIPS folder, you can find the solution with all of the code necessary to run the program. The main function is under Program.cs,
but this just makes an instance PipeLinedDataPath and executes the pipeline stages. 

I decided to rewrite a MIPS program I wrote about a year ago in C++ . I had included everything in one file to make grading easier in that case. I included the output and code under MIPSC++ . The assingment is pipelineproject_CS472_2016_Spring.pdf

I am still working on the unit tests, but I got a couple of them working correctly.
