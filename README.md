# MIPS
Simple MIPS Simulator

Under the MIPS folder, you can find the solution with all of the code necessary to run the program. The main function is under Program.cs,
but this just makes an instance PipeLinedDataPath and executes the pipeline stages. 

I was using git through Visual Studio so it looks like it created multiple vcs files. This is not preventing the program from running, but
I'm going to clean up these files soon.

I am still working on the unit tests, but I got a couple of them working correctly.
