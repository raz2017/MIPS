# MIPS
Simple MIPS Simulator


Under the MIPS folder, you can find the code for the MIPS.sln .  The main function is under Program.cs,
but this just makes an instance PipeLinedDataPath and executes the pipeline stages. 

I decided to rewrite a MIPS program I wrote about a year ago in C++ . I had included everything in one file to make grading easier in that case. I included the output and code under MIPSC++ . The assingment is pipelineproject_CS472_2016_Spring.pdf

I am still working on the unit tests, but I got a couple of them working correctly. The program needs polishing, but I'm running into time constraints!

The C# program has bugs, but I mainly wanted to work on a better structure for the program than what I had for the C++ program. The C++ compiles and gives the correct result 100%.
